This is a classic mathematical puzzle credited to the French mathematician
Ã‰douard Lucas in 1883. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)

Consider a situation of three poles (or stacks), and a number (n) of disks of
different unique sizes.

The puzzle starts with all disk stacked and ordered on the first pole with the
biggest at the bottom, and the smallest at the top.

Here is a simple text based representation of the start state with only three
disks (n=3).

    |       |       |
   *|*      |       |
  **|**     |       |
 ***|***    |       |

The goal (end state) is to move all the disks from the starting pole to a
target pole while following three simple rules:
1. you can only move one disk at a time
2. you can only move the top disk from a pole
3. you can not put a larger disk on top a smaller disk.

The problem can be solved using both iterative and recursive approaches.
Because of this, it is a classic teaching example for recusion in programming
subjects around the world.

The minimal number of moves to solve a puzzle like this is 2^n - 1.
So for 3 disks it takes, 2^3 -1 = 2*2*2 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7
(In python maths, power is writen as ** and so expressed as moves = 2**3 -1 )

Our objective is this unit is to use the puzzle as a state-based system
represented as a search graph (tree), and is a good basis for later
uses of graphs and graph search for problem solving and AI for Games.

Because of this, we will start first with a verbose iterative approach.
